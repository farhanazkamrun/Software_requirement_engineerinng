# üìö Online Platform for Local Informal Skilled People ‚Äì SRE Report

This repository contains the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** and **SRE analysis** for a conceptual online platform that connects local informal skilled workers (such as electricians, plumbers, and tailors) with clients.

The platform is designed to address **language and accessibility barriers** faced by workers in Bangladesh by allowing them to upload voice recordings in regional dialects (Sylheti, Chittagonian, Bangla, English) to showcase their skills.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This was an academic design project. No software implementation was carried out.
